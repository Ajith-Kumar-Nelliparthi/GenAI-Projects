# Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) Tokenizer with Embedding Visualization
This project implements a custom Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer from scratch in Python — similar to those used in modern NLP models like GPT and BERT. It also includes learned embeddings, one-hot encoding, and PCA-based visualization of the token embedding space.

## Features

**BPE Tokenizer Training**
Learns token merges from raw text using a frequency-based approach.

**Encoding & Decoding**
Converts text into token IDs and reconstructs it back to readable text.

**One-Hot Encoding**
Converts token IDs to one-hot encoded vectors.

**Learned Embedding Layer**
Initializes random embeddings for tokens and retrieves embedding vectors.

**Embedding Visualization**
Uses PCA to visualize token embeddings in a 2D space.

**Cosine Similarity**
Computes similarity between any two token embeddings.
